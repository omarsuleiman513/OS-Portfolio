    <h1>Big Soft Ginger Cookies</h1>
    <img src = "gcookie.jpg" alt="cookie" width="500">
    <p>Big, soft, gingerbread cookies made with molasses, ginger, and other spices are a holiday favorite. This gingerbread cookie recipe for ginger cookies rolled in sugar is my oldest son's favorite. Store cooled cookies in an airtight container and they will stay soft for days.</p>

    <ul>
       <li> 2 tablespoons white sugar</li>

       <li> 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
